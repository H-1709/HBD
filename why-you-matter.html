  <h1>Why You Matter</h1>

  <p class="hero-text">
    Distance has never been the measure of closeness.  
    Some people stand nearby and still feel far…  
    and some souls - like you - remain quietly close,
    no matter the space between.
    <br><br>
    There is a steadiness in you.  
    A calm strength in the way you handle life.  
    The kind that makes ordinary moments feel safe.
    <br><br>
    You may not always notice your own impact…  
    but it is there.The way you listen, the way you care, the way you simply are,it matters
